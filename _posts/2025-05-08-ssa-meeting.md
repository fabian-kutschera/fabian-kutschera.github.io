I was honored to be one of the 2025 Student Travel Grant Recipients of the Seismological Society of America (see [
Past Annual Meeting Travel Grant Recipients](https://www.seismosoc.org/awards/travel-grant-types/past-annual-meeting-travel-grant-recipients)), which allowed me to attend their annual meeting in Baltimore, MD, from April 14-18. Here, I had once more the opportunity to present recently published work on the [Noto Peninsula earthquake and tsunami](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL109790), highlighting the need of using accurate earthquake models that incorporate realistic fault geometries for rapid tsunami modeling and early warning.

A summary of the meeting program together will all submitted abstracts is available below:

The received travel grant was made possible by member contributions to the Kanamori Fund and the Annual Meeting Travel Grant Fund.
