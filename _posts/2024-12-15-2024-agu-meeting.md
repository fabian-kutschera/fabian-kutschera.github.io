The American Geophysical Union (AGU) Annual Meeting was a blast. With **over 25,000 attendees** from **100+ countries**, this has been the largest Earth and space science conference I have ever been to. As part of an oral session about _[Recent Earthquakes Across the Globe: Analysis of Main Shocks, Aftershocks, and Secondary Hazards for Preparation, Rapid Response, and Recovery](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu24/meetingapp.cgi/Session/237806)_, I presented our recently [published](https://fabian-kutschera.github.io/publications) study on the multi-event and multi-segment rupture propagation of the 2024 moment magnitude 7.5 Noto Peninsula, Japan, earthquake and how it governs tsunami generation. Using a multiple Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) Bayesian inversion for tsunami modeling is a new approach and sparked interest of the scientific community. Other exciting presentations that shed light on this earthquake include [landscape changes](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu24/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1572478), [closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage analysis for tsunami detection](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu24/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1728466), hypotheses about the rupture onset with [dual-initiation](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu24/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1644514) in connection with a strong fault asperity versus [re-nucleation](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu24/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1690033) due to preceding fluid migration and fault valving behavior, [urgent marine seismic observation](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu24/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1571751) in the source region using ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) to obtain precise aftershocks, and many others.
