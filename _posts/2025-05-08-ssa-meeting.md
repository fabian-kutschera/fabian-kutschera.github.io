I was honored to be one of the 2025 Student Travel Grant Recipients of the Seismological Society of America (see [
Past Annual Meeting Travel Grant Recipients](https://www.seismosoc.org/awards/travel-grant-types/past-annual-meeting-travel-grant-recipients)), which allowed me to attend their annual meeting in Baltimore, MD, from April 14-18. Here, I had once more the opportunity to present recently published work on the [Noto Peninsula earthquake and tsunami](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL109790), highlighting the need of using accurate earthquake models that incorporate realistic fault geometries for rapid tsunami modeling and early warning.

Key points of this work are:
- Multiple CMT Bayesian inversion indicates **six subevents** with **bilateral** rupture propagation, and **delayed re-nucleation** at its hypocenter, consistent with fault weakening
- The **multi-fault subevent model** aligns with known fault system geometries and is critical in explaining the observed tsunami
- Analysis of alternative source models and of the multi-CMT ensemble shows **complex source effects** are important for realistic tsunami models
- Our iterative approach does not require manual calibration and could potentially be deployed in tsunami early warning centers

The received travel grant was made possible by member contributions to the Kanamori Fund and the Annual Meeting Travel Grant Fund.

A huge thanks to the SSA staff for organizing this conference and, of course, to all attendees who made it a great success. This concludes this blog post for now. No liability is taken for the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness.
