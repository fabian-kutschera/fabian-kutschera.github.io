Another successful [CRESCENT Annual Meeting](https://cascadiaquakes.org/2025/01/22/october-2025-annual-meeting) concluded last week at the University of Washington, Seattle. This meeting marked the start of the 3rd year of what is a remarkable community effort to push scientific and societal impact of the project by (1) showcasing advances in subduction zone science, (2) providing an update across CRESCENT activities on progress and next steps, and (3) fostering connections between working & special interest groups as well as other collaborators.

As part of the Annual Meeting, I had the opportunity to give a short overview of some of the recent work within the [DET Working Group](https://cascadiaquakes.org/det) entitled **"CRESCENT Tsunami Benchmark (TTPV1 and TTPV2): 3D fully coupled earthquake dynamic rupture and tsunami benchmarks with varying bathymetric complexity"**. With our benchmark exercise, we bring modelers together and provide a consistent framework to test numerical codes as computational infrastructure changes and model complexity increases. Our benchmark description can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15389414). Keep an eye out for the next workshop on **"At the Shallow Frontier: Faulting, Deformation, and Tsunamigenesis in Cascadia"**, where we plan to dive more into the topics of 

1. Physics of shallow tsunamigenesis
2. Shallow faulting and deformation
3. Implications for hazard and operational frameworks.
