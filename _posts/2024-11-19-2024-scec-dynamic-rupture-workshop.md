On November 4th 2024, the SCEC Dynamic Rupture community convened online and tackled new [benchmark](https://strike.scec.org/cvws) problems of simulating spontaneous (dynamic) earthquake rupture on a shallowly dipping fault near Earth’s surface. In this benchmark exercise, rupture reaches Earth’s surface in TPV36, and rupture stops before reaching Earth’s surface in TPV37. Results of all of the modelers’ simulations for TPV36 and TPV37 were presented by [Michael Barall](https://central.scec.org/user/mbarall) and can be found [online](https://www.scec.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_Dynamic_Rupture_Workshop_1005_Barall.pdf).

**49 participants** registered for the workshop and discussed updates to computational codes. Group leaders presented state-of-the-art science teams are working on, which can be found [here](https://www.scec.org/events/2024-scec-dynamic-rupture-workshop). Students, postdocs, and early career scientists also had the opportunity to share new discoveries for the dynamic rupture community using 100-second lightning talks.

My lightning talk entitled "**3D fully coupled earthquake dynamic rupture and tsunami modeling**" is linked below has two governing research questions:

1. What can we learn when combining earthquake dynamic rupture models and tsunami simulations?
2. Does source complexity govern tsunami generation?

I had the chance to address those points in more detail during the CRESCENT Tsunami Topical Workshop, which took place November 7-8 at the University of Oregon, Eugene. I recommend to check out this blog post for more information: [The science of planning for future tsunamis](crescent-tsunami-workshop).

I want to thank all participants for an insightful workshop. This concludes this blog post for now. No liability is taken for the accuracy, completeness or timeliness.
