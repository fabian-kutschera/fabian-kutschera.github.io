# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: I recently completed the Masters Programme in Geophysics offered by LMU and TUM in Munich. So far, my focus lies on computational seismology and tsunami genesis caused by coseismic seafloor displacement. I combined both of these fields in my MSc Thesis about the 2020 Mw 7.0 Samos earthquake and tsunami and in my BSc Thesis. The latter covered earthquake-tsunami modeling for North Iceland, following a physics-based approach and using high performance computing. Extended results were presented at the virtual EGU General Assembly 2021, on-site at EGU GA 2022 as well as at NorthQuake 2022. Please check the publications/<a href="https://fabian-kutschera.github.io/conferences">conferences</a> tab for more information. In addition to academia, I gained first experience within the reinsurance industry and supported the Cat Risk Management Team (R&D, GIS and Portfolio Analytics) at Allianz SE Reinsurance. In September 2023, I start as a Geopyhsics PhD candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego.
