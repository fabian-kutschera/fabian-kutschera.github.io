From 16-23 October, the [Geo-INQUIRE Sicily Summer School 2025 - Novel technologies and observing systems for geohazard and environmental monitoring: integrated approach of the Eastern Sicily test bed](https://www.geo-inquire.eu/dissemination/summer-schools/geo-inquire-sicily-summer-school-2025) took place in Aci Trezza (Catania), Italy. We were a total of **40 early career scientists**, who came together to discuss about (1) fiber optic sensing, (2) sensors and observation systems for environmental monitoring, and (3) current research infrastructure services and the [Geo-INQUIRE](https://www.geo-inquire.eu) project's objectives. 

As part of the summer school, we got to hike Mt. Etna volcano (pictures below) and had the opportunity to visit the [INFN KM3NeT](https://www.infn.it/en/research/flagship-projects/km3net) facility in Capo Passero, which recently detected an [ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrino](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08543-1). To power the detection system offshore Capo Passero, a 100 km electro-optical cable is used. This cable with glass fibers enclosed is also continuously monitored using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS; or DDAS = distributed dynamic strain sensing), which makes it important not only for high-energy physics, but also for geophysical applications.

After the summer school has concluded, a small group of us had the chance to visit the INGV in Catania, which is the center for monitoring volcanic activity for the Etna, Stromboli, and Vulcano. Here, we saw live on-screen how a small eruption at Stromboli occurred (visible in the thermal image below), something the INGV staff is used to see, but left quite an impression for us visiting. It is the perfect example showcasing why continuous monitoring is essential, which would not be possible without all the scientific achievements in the past.
